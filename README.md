🌎 With Cornell Certificate and a Masters degree in tourism management,I have international experience in this industry in managerial positions. Since the beginning I had a true passion for data, and after some years understanding how businesses work and how to operate from entry to management levels,I'm on an exciting learning journey that I want to share with you.

📊 After completing a bootcamp in Data Science and Machine Learning, I'm ready to tackle new challenges and dive into the world of data.

🗣️ Fluent in English, Spanish, and French, I love working in multicultural environments.

💡 Adaptable, curious, and always eager to learn something new. Let's transform data into intelligent decisions together!

🤝 Skilled in turning data into meaningful decisions and specialist at thinking out of the box in order to find hidden solutions to the problems I may be facing.

👫 Empathy and logic-driven, focused on building genuine connections and meaningful relationships. I am a teamplayer and I work hard as much as I like to play hard.

🌱 Highly adaptable to new challenges, work methods, and dynamic environments.

✈️  I have full geographic availability, both nationally and internationally.
