🌎 With international experience from entry level to managerial positions in the tourism industry I found out during my career a true passion for data, and after some years understanding how a business work and how important data and the quality of data is for it, I'm on an exciting learning journey that I want to share with you.

📊 After completing a bootcamp in Data Science and Machine Learning, I'm ready to tackle new challenges and dive into the world of data.

🗣️ Fluent in English, Spanish, and French, I love working in multicultural environments. I'm also learning some german in my spare time just for fun.

💡 Adaptable, curious, and always eager to learn something new. Let's transform data into intelligent decisions together!

🤝 Skilled in turning data into meaningful decisions and specialist at thinking out of the box in order to find hidden solutions to the problems I may be facing.

👫 Empathy and logic-driven, focused on building genuine connections and meaningful relationships. I am a teamplayer and I work hard as much as I like to play hard.

🌱 Highly adaptable to new challenges, work methods, and dynamic environments.

✈️  I have full geographic availability, both nationally and internationally.

## 🌱 Projects

#### 🍷 WINEMEAPP WINE RECOMMENDATOR _*([Public](https://github.com/ivanpgdata/WineMeApp/tree/main))*_
A **recommendation model** that takes the tasting notes from a wine (after checking if it is in our database) and shows you the most similar wines from the dataset. It is displayed on streamlit and uses github as a host, all coded in python.


#### 🏬 HOTEL PROJECT _*([Public](https://github.com/ivanpgdata/Hotel_Project))*_
This project is being made in order to sharpen some skills and practice some new ones, therefore it covers:
* EDA    
* K-Means Clustering
* PCA
* XGBoost Forecasting
* Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test (ADF)

#### 📷 IMAGE RELATED PROJECT  _*([Public](https://github.com/ivanpgdata/Image_Related))*_    
In this repository you will find some image related projects. Maybe I read something about a library and I want to try how that works, or maybe an idea came to my mind and I am going to go for it just for fun 😄

#### 🎵 AUDIO CLASSIFIER  _*([Public](https://github.com/ivanpgdata/AUDIO_CLASSIFIER))*_    
This project will have an audio classifier trained with IRMAS. The objective will be to create an algorythm that, depending on the audio you send him, it will let you know which instrument is being played from the training dataset 🎹 🎷 🎺 🎸 🎻 
I have created 2 ML models one with CNN and other with Dense Layers, with a particular result.


#### 🛠 EXERCISES ([Public](https://github.com/ivanpgdata/Exercises))

This repository will have numerous exercises that I do just for fun. It will mostly be interview questions that I have found on github or sometimes some exercises that I will do if I want to see if I can do something either using something that I have no clue about or a new tool that got my attention while I was reading a random post on LinkedIn or a tech newsletter.

#### 🐙 MASTERING GIT WITH GITKRAKEN 🐙 ([Public](https://github.com/ivanpgdata/Gitkraken_test))

In this project I have gone through mostly all the daily tasks that a **Data Scientist** do when interacting with GIT, giving access to another developer, cloning, branches, tagging, requests and releases. All that with the help of @manucabello who's has been years working with GIT and using GitKraken

#### NEXT PROJECT _*(Working on it 👷🏻 )*_

Thinking of the next project. This next project will be something that got my attention some time ago even before starting to code. As I am not sure how to aproach the project, I rather not giving too much information. Stay tuned to know about it!
